# ScatterText Visualization for the ICRC and the USA in the CCWC
Creation of a ScatterText visualization comparing the use of language of the representatives of the ICRC and the US

This is the code that was produced for the subject of "Political Speech Analysis" during my masters in the [University of Athens](https://en.uoa.gr/).\
(The text of the work study of it was cowritten with collegue Maria Kalogridi, code by myself)\

The title of the research study was the "Analysis of the political discourse of the representatives of the US and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in the annual consultations on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS) within the framework of the "Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons", in the light of international humanitarian law."\

In order to understand how the language was used in that instance I created a ScatterText visualization using the [Scattertext](https://github.com/JasonKessler/scattertext) visualization tool by Jason Kessler.

In the repo you can find the code, the text sets that we used and the produced html for these set of texts.
